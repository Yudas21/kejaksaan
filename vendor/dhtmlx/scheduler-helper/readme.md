Scheduler Helper for PHP
========================

### Requirements

- PHP>=5.4 (PDO~)
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sqlite, etc.

### Installation
 
- composer 'dhtmlx/scheduler-helper'
  
or
  
- just download the files from this repository 'git@github.com:DHTMLX/scheduler-helper-php.git'
  
```php
require_once "./SchedulerHelper.php";
use DHTMLX_Scheduler\Helper;
```

### How to use

In order to create a helper object you should call the class constructor `DHTMLX_Scheduler\Helper([$connectorDataArray]):`

```php
  $helper = new Helper(
    array(
      "dbsm" => "mysql", // optional, "mysql" by default
      "host" => "localhost", // optional, "localhost" by default
      "db_name" => "scheduler_helper_db",
      "user" => "root",
      "password" => "root",
      "table_name" => "events_rec" // name of the table that contains data of recurring events 
    )
  );
```

In the helper a standard set of fields for working with a table is defined:

```php
  helper::FLD_ID => "event_id",
  helper::FLD_START_DATE => "start_date",
  helper::FLD_END_DATE => "end_date",
  helper::FLD_TEXT => "text",
  helper::FLD_RECURRING_TYPE => "rec_type",
  helper::FLD_PARENT_ID => "event_pid",
  helper::FLD_LENGTH => "event_length"
```

To redefine the helper and create new fields, you should use the method 'setFieldsNames([$fieldsDataArray])': 

```php
  $helper->setFieldsNames(array(
    $helper::FLD_RECURRING_TYPE => "my_recurring_type_field", // redefining the field 'FLD_RECURRING_TYPE'.
    "my_property_field" // initialization of a new field
  ));
```

For getting only fields that have set, you need just to set 'true' like second parameter in the function 'setFieldsNames([$fieldsDataArray], true)'

```php
  $helper->setFieldsNames(array(
    $helper::FLD_RECURRING_TYPE => "my_recurring_type_field", // redefining the field 'FLD_RECURRING_TYPE'.
    "my_property_field" // initialization of a new field
  ), true);
```

For setting weather server time zone will be considered you should use server_date config(true by default). If true helper will use server time, else will use dates as it goes from database.

```php
  $helper->config["server_date"] = true;
```

To save data to the database, use the method 'saveData([dataArray])':

```php
  // To save data of the field 'FLD_RECURRING_TYPE', you can use a data array or a string in the format 'week_2_____1,3#10'.
  $newRecurringTypeArray = array(
    "each" => "week",
    "step" => 2,
    "days_of_week" => "monday,wednesday", // if the field 'week_number' is set, the field 'days_of_week' must contain only one value
  //  "week_number" => 2,
    "repeat" => 10
  );

  $helper->saveData(array(
  //    $helper::FLD_ID => "20", // if you pass this field for saving, data in the database will be updated by this value, otherwise new data will be written
    $helper::FLD_RECURRING_TYPE => $newRecurringTypeArray,
    $helper::FLD_START_DATE => "2015-09-30 00:00:00",
    $helper::FLD_END_DATE => $helper->getRecurringEndDateStr($newRecurringTypeArray, "2015-09-30 00:00:00", 500), // to count the end date of the recurring series, you can use the function 'getRecurringEndDateStr'
    $helper::FLD_LENGTH => 500,
    "my_property_field" => "Any data..." // new fields defined by the user must be presented in this way
  ));
```

To delete data from the database, you should use the method 'deleteById([ID])':

```php
  $helper->deleteById(48); // will delete data by the field 'FLD_ID'.
```

To get data of the recurring events, use the method 'getData([$startDateStr], [$endDateStr])':

```php
  $helper->getData("2015-02-10 09:00:00", "2020-01-02 07:00:00");
  
  // The function will return recurring events from the defined range taking into account exclusion of events series
  // The result will look as follows:
  //array(
  //  array(
  //   "start_date" => "2015-02-13 00:00:00",
  //   "end_date" => "2015-02-15 00:00:00",
  //   "text" => "Second Friday",
  //   ...
  //  ),
  //  ....
  //);
```
